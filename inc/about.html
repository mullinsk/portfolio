<h2>About</h2>

<p>
<img class="photo" src="img/self.jpg">
	Hello! My name is Kathleen Mullins. I am a front-end web developer with interest in full stack development.  I studied Computer Science and Interactive Media at Northeastern University in Boston, and have 3 years of experience in the field from course work, personal projects, and co-ops, as well as experience in graphic and user interaction design. 
</p>
<p>
	Through all of these I have had the opportunity to do everything from researching sentiment analysis algorithms for an open source intelligence collection tool, to designing layouts for Northeastern Unisversity's Woof Magazine, developing prototypes and live CMS for large brands such as FedEx and MIT, and blending fine art with computation through research.
</p>
<p>
	In my free time I enjoy reading, cooking, sewing, travelling, and photography. When I'm not in classes or at work, you are sure to find me doing one of these things!

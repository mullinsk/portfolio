	Hello! My name is Kathleen Mullins. I am a front-end web developer with interest in full stack web development.  I studied Computer Science and Interactive Media at Northeastern University in Boston, and have 3 years of experience in the field from course work, personal projects, and co-ops. 
</p>
<p>
	I am also interested in graphic design and User Experience Design. I have worked on the Creative team for Woof Magazine doing print layout design at Northeastern University for the past year. There I honed my Adobe InDesign and Illustrator Skills. I've also done some coursework in UX and was exposed to it in my co-ops.

	In my free time I enjoy reading, cooking, sewing, travelling, and photography. When I'm not in classes or at work, you are sure to find me doing one of these things!
